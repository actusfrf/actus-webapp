- Following modified (preceding): Same like following (preceding), however if a cash flow gets shifted into a new month, then  it is shifted to preceding (following) business day.
- Shift/calculate (SC) and calculate/shift (CS). Accrual, principal, and possibly other calculations are affected by this choice. In the case of SC first the dates are shifted and after the shift cash flows are calculated. In the case of CS it is the other way round.
