Accrual, principal, and possibly other calculations are affected by this choice. In the case of SC first the dates are shifted and after the shift cash flows are calculated. In the case of CS it is the other way round.nAttention: Does not affect non-cyclical dates such as PRD, MD, TD, IPCED since they can be set to the correct date directly.",

If SM is selected, it will jump to the 30st always with of course an exception in February. nThis logic applies for all months having 30 or less days and an anchor date at the last day.
